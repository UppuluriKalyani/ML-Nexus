    </section>

    <section class="sec">
      <h2>1. Solar Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Solar energy harnesses power from the sun's radiation. This energy can
        be converted into electricity or heat using technologies like solar
        panels (photovoltaic cells) and solar thermal systems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Photovoltaic (PV) Systems: Convert sunlight directly into electricity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Solar Thermal Systems: Capture heat from the sun to heat water or air
          for residential and industrial use.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Abundant and available worldwide.</li>
        <li>Low operational costs after installation.</li>
        <li>Scalable from small homes to large power plants.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Intermittent availability (only during the day or when the weather is
          clear).
        </li>
        <li>Requires significant space for large installations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="sec">
      <h2>2. Wind Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Wind energy is captured by turbines that convert the kinetic energy from
        wind into electricity. Wind farms can be onshore (land) or offshore
        (water).
      </p>

      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Produces no emissions during operation.</li>
        <li>Suitable for large-scale power generation.</li>
        <li>Can be combined with other land uses, such as agriculture.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wind is variable and intermittent.</li>
        <li>Turbines can be noisy and impact landscapes.</li>
        <li>
          Concerns about the effect on wildlife, especially birds and bats.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="sec">
      <h2>3. Hydropower</h2>
      <p>
        Hydropower uses the energy of moving water (rivers, waterfalls, tides)
        to generate electricity. It is one of the most established renewable
        energy sources.
      </p>

      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reliable and capable of generating large amounts of electricity.
        </li>
        <li>Provides water storage and flood control benefits.</li>
        <li>Can produce power continuously (baseload energy).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can disrupt local ecosystems and displace communities.</li>
        <li>
          Requires large amounts of water and specific geographic conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="sec">
      <h2>4. Biomass Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Biomass energy comes from organic materials like plants, wood,
        agricultural residues, and waste. Biomass can be burned directly or
        converted into biofuels or biogas.
      </p>

      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilizes waste products and reduces landfill use.</li>
        <li>Can be converted into liquid fuels for transportation.</li>
        <li>Carbon-neutral if managed sustainably.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can lead to deforestation if not managed sustainably.</li>
        <li>May emit air pollutants if not properly controlled.</li>
        <li>Requires large land areas for growing biomass feedstock.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="sec">
      <h2>5. Geothermal Energy</h2>
      <p>
        Geothermal energy taps into heat from the Earth's core to generate
        electricity or provide direct heating by accessing underground
        reservoirs of hot water and steam.
      </p>

      <h3>Advantages:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides continuous (baseload) energy, unlike solar or wind.</li>
        <li>Low emissions compared to fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Small land footprint.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Limited to areas with significant geothermal activity.</li>
        <li>
          High upfront costs for exploration and infrastructure development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Can release small amounts of harmful gases trapped beneath the earth's
          surface.
        </li>
      </ul>
