# Exam Score Prediction with Linear Regression


## Overview

This project implements a linear regression model from scratch to predict exam scores based on study hours and other relevant features. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the linear regression algorithm and its application in educational data analysis.


## Features

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to Visualize Relationships
- Implementation of Linear Regression Algorithm from Scratch
- Model Evaluation Using Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. You can run the main script to view the predictions and evaluations.


## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project consists of study hours and corresponding exam scores. It can be found in the data directory.


## Model Implementation

The linear regression model is implemented in the (link unavailable) file. It includes functions for calculating the coefficients, making predictions, and fitting the model to the training data.


## Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
- R-squared: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the data.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
