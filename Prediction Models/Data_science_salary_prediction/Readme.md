# Data Scientist Salary Prediction

## Overview
This project is designed to predict the salaries of data scientists using a dataset that includes various factors like job title, experience level, employment type, and company location. With machine learning models, we aim to create an accurate prediction system for salaries within the data science domain, which is valuable for job-seekers, recruiters, and companies.

## Problem Statement
The data science field has a significant range of salary distributions based on multiple variables, making it challenging to predict compensation accurately. This model addresses this challenge by analyzing the influence of experience, job role, employment type, and location to provide a reliable salary estimate.

## Features
- **Experience Level**: Different levels from entry to senior roles.
- **Employment Type**: Type of employment (e.g., full-time, part-time, contract).
- **Job Title**: Various roles within data science.
- **Company Location**: Geographical location impacting salaries.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information across multiple years and includes the following columns:
- `work_year`
- `experience_level`
- `employment_type`
- `job_title`
- `salary`
- `employee_residence`
- `remote_ratio`
