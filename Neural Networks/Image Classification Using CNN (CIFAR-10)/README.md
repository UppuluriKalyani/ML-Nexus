## Project Structure
- `Image_Classification_Using_CNN_(CIFAR_10).ipynb`- Contains the .ipynb file (Jupyter notebook).
- `Model_Prediction.sav` - Contains model saved using Pickle which can be deployed in production environments where it will serve predictions based on incoming data. The Pickle format makes it easy to integrate with various frameworks, such as Flask, Django, or FastAPI.
    
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `.ipynb` notebook.
3. The Model_Prediction.sav will be saved.
