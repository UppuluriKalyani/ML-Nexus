## Potato Image Classification

### Model Overview
In this project, we aim to classify potato plant health into three categories: 

- **Early Blight**
- **Healthy**
- **Late Blight**

### Results
The classification model achieved an impressive accuracy of **98.02%** on the testing dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in distinguishing between healthy plants and those affected by early and late blight.
