# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## 📝 Description
The Breast Cancer Classification Project is a deep learning application designed to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. This project utilizes a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras and is fully implemented within a Google Colab notebook for ease of experimentation and access.

## 🎯 Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases based on numerical data features, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment decisions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
Source: The dataset is the Breast Cancer dataset available in sklearn, containing key characteristics of tumors.
Data Features: Includes numerical attributes related to tumor measurements and properties.
Classes: Two target classes—benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous).
Dataset Split: The dataset is divided into an 80-20 split for training and testing.

## 🚀 Features
Neural Network Model: Built with TensorFlow and Keras, featuring input, hidden, and output layers.
Performance Visualization: Training and validation accuracy and loss are tracked and visualized to assess model performance.
Predictive System: A simple function is included to classify new data inputs, predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

## 🔍 Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, explore data distribution, and standardize features for improved model performance.
Model Building: Define a neural network with input, hidden, and output layers to capture the patterns in the data.
Training and Validation: Train the model on 80% of the data, validating it with a 10% validation split to monitor accuracy and loss over epochs.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test data and visualize metrics like accuracy and loss.
Prediction System: Test the model’s real-world application by classifying new data points.

## 💻 Tech Stack
Python: Primary programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework used to build and train the model.
Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
Google Colab: Provides a cloud-based environment for running the project.

## ⚙️ How to Run
Open the Notebook:
Access the Google Colab notebook by uploading it to your Colab environment.
Execute Cells:
Run each cell in sequence to load data, preprocess it, build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Test Predictions:
Use the predictive system function within the notebook to classify new data points.
###🧪 Models and Performance
The neural network model is evaluated based on:

Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
Loss: Measures the error in prediction, helping to monitor overfitting or underfitting.

##📈 Results
The model achieves satisfactory accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Training and validation metrics are plotted to visualize model performance over epochs.
