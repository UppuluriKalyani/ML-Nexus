## Supervised learning ðŸ“š

Supervised learning is a core machine learning approach where models are trained on labeled datasets, consisting of input-output pairs. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs by identifying patterns in the training data. This technique is commonly used for tasks such as classification (e.g., spam detection, image recognition) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).

### Key Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Models can make reliable predictions based on learned data.
- **Interpretability**: Relationships between input features and output labels are often clear, aiding in understanding model decisions.
- **Wide Applications**: Supervised learning is employed in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and marketing.

### Common Challenges

- **Data Quality**: High-quality labeled data is essential for effective training.
- **Overfitting**: Models may become too complex and perform poorly on new, unseen data.
- **Class Imbalance**: Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased predictions favoring the majority class.
