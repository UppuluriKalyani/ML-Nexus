## Transfer learning ðŸ”„

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that involves taking a pre-trained model developed for one task and fine-tuning it for a different, but related, task. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from a previously trained model to improve performance on new tasks, particularly when labeled data is scarce.

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced Training Time**: By starting with a pre-trained model, you can significantly decrease the time required to train a model for a new task.
- **Improved Performance**: Transfer learning often results in better performance, especially when the new task has limited data, as the model can utilize previously learned features.
- **Resource Efficiency**: It requires fewer computational resources compared to training a model from scratch.

### Common Challenges

- **Domain Differences**: If the source and target tasks are too dissimilar, transfer learning may not be effective, leading to poor performance.
- **Overfitting**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a small dataset can sometimes lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
- **Feature Misalignment**: The features learned by the pre-trained model may not always align well with the requirements of the new task.
